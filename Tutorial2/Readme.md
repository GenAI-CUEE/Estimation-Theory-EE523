## Tutorial 2: estimator properties 

by *Suwichaya Suwanwimolkul, Ph.D.* 


Let's start 

<a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/GabbySuwichaya/Estimation-Theory-EE523/blob/master/Tutorial2/main.ipynb">
  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a>

or you can run `main.ipynb` locally for the coding exercies and examples used as parts of `Lecture I` 

The topics covered in the colab page and `main.ipynb`  are: 
 
- [Estimator Properties](#estimator-properties)
    - [Bianess](#biasness)
    - [MSE](#mse)
    - [Consistency](#consistency)
- [HW](#homework)
    - [Empirical Variance Estimator](#empirical-variance-estimator)
    - [Sample Variance Estimator](#sample-variance-estimator)
     
### Quick start 

You can try it locally ... Just install dependenies listed in `requirements.txt` by 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, start the jupyternote book [`main.ipynb`](main.ipynb).
 

 
### Final Notes.
-  The coding examples of sampling, biased, and unbiased estimation are adopted from [Sampling \& Estimation EP.3 by Khalel Corona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNbDigYLqSY).
-  Don't forget to install the dependency `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `utils.py` contains the supplenmary implementations for each fucntion used in `main.ipynb` 
- Good luck!
