## Tutorial 1: What is an estimator? 

by *Suwichaya Suwanwimolkul, Ph.D.*

Let's start

</a>

or you can run `main.ipynb` locally. 

The topics covered in the colab page and `main.ipynb`  is sampling from distribution:  
     
### Quick start 

You can try it locally ... Just install dependenies listed in `requirements.txt` by 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, start the jupyternote book [`main.ipynb`](main.ipynb).
 

 
### Final Notes.
-  The coding examples of sampling, biased, and unbiased estimation are adopted from [Sampling \& Estimation EP.3 by Khalel Corona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNbDigYLqSY).
-  Don't forget to install the dependency `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `utils.py` contains the supplenmary implementations for each fucntion used in `main.ipynb` 
- Good luck!
